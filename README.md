#Testing_Intern

Introduction

This test suite is designed to validate the functionality and data consistency of the Conqt platform. It includes tests for page loading, API endpoints, data consistency between pages and APIs, contrast ratios, and discernible links.
Test Suite Components
1. Page Load Tests
These tests check if the specified pages load successfully.
Functions:

•	test_page_load(url): Checks if a page at the given URL loads successfully.
•	test_conqt_pages_load(): Iterates over a list of URLs and checks if each page loads successfully.
3. API Endpoint Tests
These tests verify if the specified API endpoints are reachable and return the expected status code.
Functions:

•	test_api_endpoint(url, expected_status=200): Checks if the API at the given URL returns the expected status code.
•	test_all_api_endpoints(): Iterates over a list of API URLs and checks if each API returns the expected status code.
4. Data Consistency Tests
These tests ensure that the data displayed on the pages is consistent with the data returned by the corresponding API endpoints.
Functions:

•	test_data_consistency(page_url, api_url): Compares data between a page and its corresponding API endpoint.
•	test_conqt_data_consistency(): Iterates over a list of page-API URL pairs and checks data consistency for each pair.
5. Contrast Ratio Tests
These tests (placeholder) are intended to check if the contrast ratios on the specified pages meet the accessibility criteria.

Functions:
•	test_contrast_ratio(html_content): Placeholder for implementing contrast ratio check logic.
•	test_conqt_contrast_ratios(): Iterates over a list of URLs and checks the contrast ratios on each page.
5. Discernible Links Tests
These tests ensure that all links on the specified pages have discernible text.
Functions:
•	test_discernible_links(html_content): Checks if all links on the page have discernible text.
•	test_conqt_discernible_links(): Iterates over a list of URLs and checks if all links on each page have discernible text.
6. Parametrized Tests
These tests use pytest's parametrization feature to run the same test function with different inputs.
Functions:
•	test_pages(url): Parametrized test to check if a page loads successfully.
•	test_apis(api_url): Parametrized test to check if an API endpoint returns the expected status code.
•	test_data_consistency_pages(page_url, api_url): Parametrized test to check data consistency between a page and its API endpoint.
•	test_contrast(url): Parametrized test to check the contrast ratios on a page.
•	test_links(url): Parametrized test to check if all links on a page have discernible text.
How to Run the Tests
Prerequisites
1.	Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2.	pip: Ensure you have pip installed for package management.
3.	Virtual Environment (optional but recommended): Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
Install Dependencies
1.	Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate



2.	Install the required packages:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pytest
Running the Tests
1.	Save the test code to a file named test_conqt.py.
2.	Run the tests using pytest:
3.	pytest test_conqt.py
Example Output
The test results will be displayed in the terminal. You will see a summary of passed, failed, and errored tests along with detailed error messages for failed and errored tests.
Additional Notes
•	Ensure that the Conqt platform's URLs and API endpoints are correct and accessible.
•	Implement the contrast ratio check logic in the test_contrast_ratio function as needed.
By following these instructions, you should be able to set up and run the test suite for the Conqt platform.
